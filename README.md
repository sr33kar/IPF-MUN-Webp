# IPF-MUN_Webp
This is the portfolio that was set active at the time of registrations for NITCMUN'19,IPF NITC.

-> This project has five pages in main.

-> Main,Overview,DISEC,UNHRC,CONTACTS

-> This has nothing to do with viewer or user's details or entries.

-> No forms are presnt in this entire website.

-> There is a link present in almost all pages that lead to a registration portal which takes the details of the registrations.

-> This is plainly a web page project that shows what NITCMUN is all about with some animations and text effects involved.
